-- ====================
-- QUERY PERFORMANCE NOTES
-- ====================

/*
For optimal performance on large datasets:

1. **Create indexes**:
   CREATE INDEX idx_trades_mint_timestamp ON first_day_trades(mint, block_timestamp);
   CREATE INDEX idx_trades_sol_mint ON first_day_trades(swap_from_mint, swap_to_mint);
   CREATE INDEX idx_trades_succeeded ON first_day_trades(succeeded);

2. **Partitioning** (if supported):
   Consider partitioning by date if data spans multiple days

3. **Memory considerations**:
   - This query processes all coins at once
   - For very large datasets, consider adding WHERE mint IN (...) to process specific coins
   - Expected reduction: ~1M transactions â†’ ~50K OHLC records

4. **Alternative for specific coins**:
   Add this WHERE clause before ORDER BY:
   WHERE mint IN ('coin1', 'coin2', 'coin3')

5. **Validation queries**:
   -- Check price ranges
   SELECT MIN(open), MAX(high), AVG(vwap) FROM final_output;
   
   -- Check record counts
   SELECT COUNT(*) as total_records, COUNT(DISTINCT mint) as unique_coins FROM final_output;
   
   -- Top coins by volume
   SELECT mint, SUM(sol_volume) as total_volume FROM final_output GROUP BY mint ORDER BY 2 DESC LIMIT 10;
