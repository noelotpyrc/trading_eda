# Goal

Use the default setups of Backtrader as much as possible, rather than implementing custom data feeds, strategy, broker, analyzer, etc:

1. Convert our per transaction data to OHLVC data, also add signal column to the OHLVC data
2. Strategy should just use signal column and other position management parameters to execute trades
3. Signal column should be generated by inference features based on the original transaction data and scored by ML model

# Method

We already have `classification_forward_features` table generated by original transaction, each row is based on a sample timestamp and aggregated the stats for a look back windows [30s, 60s and 120s]. We will reuse this feature table for ML model predictions and generating the signals. This means we will have a signal table based on the same sample timestamp from the feature table.

So in order to append the signal column to the OHLVC table, we need to make sure OHLVC table is also created with the exact same sample timestamp.

Step by step, we should:

1. Pull the feature table for one coin from DuckDB, and use ML models to generate the signals
2. Also pull the transaction data (`first_day_trades`) for this coin from Duckdb, use the exact sample timestamps from feature table to generate the 1min candle stick OHLVC data
3. Merge signal with OHLVC data
