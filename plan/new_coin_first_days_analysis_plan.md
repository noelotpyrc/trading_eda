# New Coin First-Days Trading Analysis Plan

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**
Develop winning trading strategies for **new meme coins in their first 1-7 days** of trading using data-driven analysis and machine learning.

## ðŸ“Š **Core Research Priorities**

### **Priority 1: Trader Profiling for ML Enhancement (Highest ROI, Low Compute)**
**Insight**: 0.1% of traders are multi-coin specialists - their participation patterns could be powerful ML features
**Goal**: Profile trader types across ALL 5700+ coins and incorporate trader quality metrics into ML framework

**Advantage**: Can analyze all coins efficiently since we're profiling traders (not extracting 216 features per coin)

#### Research Questions:
- What trader archetypes exist in new coin launches (bots, whales, retail, pros)?
- Can we quantify "trader quality" as predictive features for ML models?
- Which trader composition patterns predict coin success/failure?
- How do early trader profiles correlate with future price movements?

#### Implementation:
```python
TRADER_PROFILING_FRAMEWORK = {
    'trader_universe': 'ALL 5700+ coins (computationally efficient)',
    'profiling_dimensions': {
        'sophistication_score': 'Multi-coin activity, timing skill, volume consistency',
        'trader_archetype': 'Bot, whale, retail, professional, arbitrageur',
        'behavioral_patterns': 'Entry timing, position sizing, holding periods',
        'success_metrics': 'Historical profitability, survival rates'
    },
    'ml_feature_engineering': {
        'trader_quality_features': [
            'avg_trader_sophistication_score',
            'whale_participation_ratio', 
            'bot_activity_percentage',
            'multi_coin_trader_count',
            'trader_diversity_index'
        ],
        'early_participation_features': [
            'first_hour_trader_quality',
            'sophisticated_trader_entry_timing',
            'retail_vs_professional_ratio',
            'trader_concentration_risk'
        ]
    }
}

ML_INTEGRATION_STRATEGY = {
    'feature_expansion': 'Add 20+ trader profiling features to existing 216 features',
    'real_time_profiling': 'Calculate trader metrics in 60-second windows',
    'predictive_modeling': 'Use trader composition to predict coin success probability',
    'regime_detection': 'Trader quality changes as regime indicator'
}
```

#### Expected Outputs:
- **Trader Classification System**: "5 trader archetypes with ML-ready scoring functions"
- **Enhanced Feature Set**: "Add 20+ trader quality features to existing 216-feature framework"
- **Predictive Models**: "Trader composition predicts coin success with 70%+ accuracy"
- **Real-time Profiling**: "Live trader quality scoring for active coins"

---

### **Priority 2: Regime-Conditional ML Trading (High ROI, High Compute)**
**Insight**: Current analysis shows ML ensemble models (Random Forest) achieve AUC 0.70 overall, but AUC jumps to 0.80+ in specific market regimes
**Goal**: Scale the 216-feature ML framework to identify regime conditions where model performance is significantly enhanced

#### Context: 
- **Enhanced Framework**: 236+ engineered features (216 existing + 20+ trader profiling from Priority 1)
- **ML Models**: Random Forest ensemble achieving AUC 0.70 baseline, enhanced with trader features
- **Regime Discovery**: Specific market conditions where enhanced ML models achieve AUC 0.80+
- **Trading Strategy**: Only trade when enhanced ML models are in high-performance regimes
- **Dependency**: Requires trader profiling features from Priority 1

#### Research Questions:
- Which market regimes cause ML model AUC to jump from 0.70 to 0.80+?
- Can we detect these high-signal regimes in real-time for new launches?
- Which of the 236+ features (including trader profiling) are most predictive of regime transitions?
- How do optimal regimes differ between successful vs failed coin launches?

#### Implementation:
```python
REGIME_ML_ANALYSIS = {
    'feature_framework': '236+ features (216 existing + 20+ trader profiling)',
    'ml_models': 'Random Forest ensemble (proven AUC 0.70)',
    'regime_detection': {
        'volatility_regimes': 'High/low volatility periods',
        'volume_regimes': 'Volume surge vs normal periods',
        'trader_regimes': 'Whale-dominated vs retail periods',
        'temporal_regimes': 'Launch phase (0-1h, 1-6h, 6-24h)',
        'momentum_regimes': 'Trending vs sideways periods'
    },
    'sample_strategy': {
        'recent_launches': 200,        # Last 60 days
        'successful_coins': 50,        # Survived >7 days with volume
        'failed_coins': 50,           # Died within 24 hours  
        'medium_performers': 100      # Everything in between
    }
}

REGIME_CONDITIONAL_STRATEGY = {
    'step_1': 'Extract 236+ features using enhanced framework (includes trader profiling)',
    'step_2': 'Run enhanced ML ensemble models for profitability prediction',
    'step_3': 'Detect current market regime using regime + trader features',
    'step_4': 'Only trade if regime shows historical AUC >0.80',
    'step_5': 'Use regime-specific model parameters for execution'
}
```

#### Expected Outputs:
- **Regime Detection Models**: ML classifier identifying high-signal regimes (AUC 0.80+)
- **Conditional Trading Rules**: "Trade only when regime classifier shows >80% confidence in high-signal state"
- **Feature Importance Maps**: "Top 20 features that predict regime transitions"
- **Real-time Implementation**: "Check regime every 60 seconds, enable/disable trading accordingly"

---

### **Priority 3: Multi-Timeframe Mean Reversion (High ROI)**
**Insight**: Price impact decay patterns from microstructure analysis
**Goal**: Exploit predictable reversions after large trades in new coins

#### Research Questions:
- How quickly do new coins revert after whale dumps/pumps?
- What trade sizes trigger reliable reversions?
- How do reversion patterns change as coins age (hour 1 vs day 7)?
- Which trader types create the most exploitable reversions?

#### Implementation:
```python
MEAN_REVERSION_ANALYSIS = {
    'sample_coins': 100,           # High-volume new launches
    'reversion_windows': [10, 30, 60, 120, 300],  # seconds
    'impact_thresholds': [0.05, 0.10, 0.20],      # 5%, 10%, 20% price moves
    'trader_categories': ['whale', 'bot', 'retail'] # Different impact patterns
}

REVERSION_STRATEGIES = {
    'whale_fade': 'Fade large (>50 SOL) trades within 30-60 seconds',
    'pump_exit': 'Exit positions after >20% moves in 5 minutes',
    'volume_spike_fade': 'Trade against extreme volume spikes',
    'launch_chaos_mean_reversion': 'First-hour volatility exploitation'
}
```

#### Expected Outputs:
- **Reversion Rules**: "After >10% move in 60s, expect 50% reversion within 300s"
- **Optimal Entry/Exit**: "Enter reversion trades 30s after impact, exit after 120s"
- **Risk Management**: "Stop loss at 2x expected reversion distance"

---

### **Priority 4: Coin Clustering for Specialized Models (High ROI)**
**Insight**: Different coin types have different trading patterns - build specialized models instead of generic ones
**Goal**: Cluster coins using trader profiling features (from Priority 1) plus trading patterns, then build optimized models per cluster
**Dependency**: Requires trader profiling features from Priority 1

#### Research Questions:
- What distinct coin archetypes exist based on trading patterns and trader behavior?
- Can we quickly classify new coins into existing clusters within first hour?
- Which features are most important for coin type classification?
- How much better do cluster-specific models perform vs generic models?

#### Implementation:
```python
COIN_CLUSTERING_FRAMEWORK = {
    'clustering_features': {
        'trader_profiling_features': '20+ features from Priority 1 (trader archetypes, sophistication scores)',
        'trader_composition': 'Bot%, whale%, retail%, professional%',
        'volume_patterns': 'Early volume dynamics, sustainability metrics',
        'trading_behavior': 'Buy/sell ratios, transaction sizes, timing patterns',
        'network_effects': 'Multi-coin trader participation, sophisticated trader attraction'
    },
    'clustering_approach': {

        'cluster_3_model': 'Optimized for retail-driven coins',
        'cluster_n_model': 'Optimized for discovered patterns'
    }
}

RAPID_CLASSIFICATION_SYSTEM = {
    'new_coin_pipeline': {
        'step_1': 'Extract early features (first 30-60 minutes)',
        'step_2': 'Classify coin into existing cluster',
        'step_3': 'Apply cluster-specific model for predictions',
        'step_4': 'Generate trading signals using specialized parameters'
    },
    'efficiency_gains': {
        'model_size': 'Smaller specialized models vs large generic model',
        'prediction_speed': 'Faster inference on focused feature sets',
        'accuracy_improvement': 'Higher performance due to specialized patterns'
    }
}
```

#### Expected Outputs:
