# Trader Profiling Framework
## Transaction-Based Analysis Roadmap for Meme Coin Trading Data

---

## **Context & Assumptions**

Based on analysis of batch 578:
- **Insiders**: Got tokens nearly free, need only few profitable sells (high efficiency, low volume)
- **Skilled Bots**: Profitable algorithms with thousands of transactions (low efficiency, high volume)  
- **Bad Bots**: High-frequency but unprofitable (negative efficiency, high volume)
- **Retail**: Mostly unprofitable, inconsistent patterns (negative efficiency, low-medium volume)

**Available Data**: Transaction records only (timestamp, amounts, buy/sell direction, trader ID)

---

## **Analysis 1: Transaction Pattern Classification**

### **Objective**: Systematically classify traders into behavioral categories

### **Metrics to Calculate**:
```python
trader_profile = {
    # Volume Metrics
    'total_transactions': int,
    'avg_sol_per_transaction': float,
    'total_sol_volume': float,
    
    # Efficiency Metrics  
    'profit_per_transaction': float,
    'win_rate': float,                    # % profitable transactions
    'profit_to_volume_ratio': float,
    
    # Timing Metrics
    'transactions_per_hour': float,
    'trading_duration_hours': float,
    'avg_time_between_trades': float,
    
    # Behavioral Metrics
    'buy_sell_ratio': float,
    'position_flip_rate': float,          # How often buy→sell or sell→buy
    'transaction_size_consistency': float  # Std dev of transaction sizes
}
```

### **Classification Rules**:
- **Insider**: High profit/txn (>10 SOL), Low volume (<100 txns), High win rate (>80%)
- **Skilled Bot**: Medium profit/txn (0.1-10 SOL), High volume (>1000 txns), Consistent patterns
- **Bad Bot**: Negative profit/txn, High volume (>1000 txns), High transaction frequency
- **Retail**: Low volume (<500 txns), Inconsistent timing, Mixed profit/txn

### **Expected Insights**:
- Distribution of trader types across the ecosystem
- Behavioral signatures that distinguish successful strategies
- Validation of our insider vs bot vs retail hypothesis

    'follow_leader_behavior': bool        # Do they trade after large transactions?
}
```

### **Analysis Approaches**:
