# Solana Swap Data EDA & Trading Strategy Development Plan

## Data Understanding

Based on initial analysis of `first_day_trades_batch_578.csv`:

**Data Structure:**
- **Dataset**: First-day trading data for a new Solana token
- **Main Token**: One specific token mint (`4kgcTW3fy28KC659Hqwvpwvsk9zRH88oDPYPnYrnefZr`)
- **Trading Pair**: Token ↔ SOL (Solana native token)
- **Time Span**: ~2 hours of trading data (first day launch)
- **Volume**: 10,000+ transactions in sample
- **Success Rate**: 100% (no failed transactions in sample)

**Key Observations:**
- Perfect 50/50 split between buying (SOL→Token) and selling (Token→SOL)
- High transaction frequency suggests automated/bot trading
- Wide range of transaction sizes (from micro to large trades)
- Clean data with no missing values

## Key Questions & Considerations

### About the Swap Mechanism:
1. **DEX Information**: Which DEX is this data from? (Raydium, Orca, Jupiter?)
2. **Token Details**: What type of token is this? (Meme coin, utility token, etc.)
3. **Launch Context**: Was this a fair launch, presale, or other launch mechanism?
4. **Liquidity Provision**: How was initial liquidity provided?

### Technical Questions:
1. **Data Completeness**: Do we have all transactions or just a sample?
2. **Multiple Batches**: How many batch files are there and what's the total time span?
3. **Token Success**: Did this token survive beyond the first day?
4. **Market Conditions**: What were broader crypto market conditions during this period?

### Strategy Questions:
1. **Capital Requirements**: What's the target capital allocation?
2. **Risk Tolerance**: What's the acceptable maximum drawdown?
3. **Frequency**: Looking for high-frequency, medium-frequency, or low-frequency strategies?
4. **Implementation**: Planning for manual or automated execution?
