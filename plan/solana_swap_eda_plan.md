# Meme Coin First-Day Trading EDA & Strategy Development Plan

## Data Understanding (Updated)

Based on initial analysis of `first_day_trades_batch_578.csv`:

**Data Structure:**
- **Dataset**: 5900+ meme coins first-day trading data from Pump.fun
- **Platforms**: Raydium/Jupiter DEXs  
- **Selection**: Coins with >$10M cumulative volume since 2024
- **Structure**: ~590 batch files, **10 coins per batch**
- **Current Focus**: Batch 578 with 10 different meme coins
- **Trading Pairs**: Each coin ↔ SOL (Solana native token)

**Key Observations from Initial Sample:**
- Multiple coins per batch (not single token analysis)
- High transaction frequency suggests bot/MEV activity
- Wide range of transaction sizes across different coins
- Clean data structure with consistent schema

## Key Questions & Considerations

### About the Swap Mechanism:
1. **DEX Information**: Which DEX is this data from? (Raydium, Orca, Jupiter?)
2. **Token Details**: What type of token is this? (Meme coin, utility token, etc.)
3. **Launch Context**: Was this a fair launch, presale, or other launch mechanism?
4. **Liquidity Provision**: How was initial liquidity provided?

### Technical Questions:
1. **Data Completeness**: Do we have all transactions or just a sample?
2. **Multiple Batches**: How many batch files are there and what's the total time span?
3. **Token Success**: Did this token survive beyond the first day?
4. **Market Conditions**: What were broader crypto market conditions during this period?

### Strategy Questions:
1. **Capital Requirements**: What's the target capital allocation?
2. **Risk Tolerance**: What's the acceptable maximum drawdown?
3. **Frequency**: Looking for high-frequency, medium-frequency, or low-frequency strategies?
4. **Implementation**: Planning for manual or automated execution?

- **Goal**: Find patterns that work across multiple coins
- **Deliverable**: `03_cross_coin_patterns.ipynb`
- **Key Questions**: Are there common success/failure patterns? Can we classify coin types?

### Step 4: Microstructure & Strategy Ideas (Final phase)
- **Goal**: Develop concrete trading strategies based on findings
- **Deliverables**: `04_microstructure_analysis.ipynb` + initial strategy concepts
- **Key Questions**: What trading opportunities exist? How can we exploit them?

### Future Phases (After 10-coin analysis)
