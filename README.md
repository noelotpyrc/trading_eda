# Intro

This project started as a vibe trading data analysis, but the NVDA results inspired me to try out quant trading with ML methods.

As the project grows, I refactored it into separate ones:

- [Solana onchain trading](https://github.com/noelotpyrc/trading_onchain) Build ML models to trade meme coins
- [CEX trading](https://github.com/noelotpyrc/trading_cex) Trying simple strategies to trade CEX assets
- [Polymarket trading](https://github.com/noelotpyrc/trading_polymarket) Trying different models for trading polymarket
